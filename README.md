## Features

- Voice recognition and response
- Task execution based on human commands
- Rule-based text processing algorithm for handling similar sounding words and misspelled text
- User-friendly interface developed using Java Swing Framework

## Backend Technology

- **Speech-to-Text**: Sphinx
- **Text-to-Speech**: Java TTS

## Text Processing

The application uses a rule-based text processing algorithm to handle text with similar sounding words or text that are misspelled. This ensures accurate interpretation and response to user commands.
